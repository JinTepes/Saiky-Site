          <h1>BEFORE</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Each one should be aware of the dangers that volcanic
                eruptions pose to lives and be prepared to face whatever
                circumstances the eruption may bring.</li>
              <li>Prepare all necessary things to bring once
                evacuation is needed. Those in danger zones are warned when to
                evacuate. Once given the signal refrain from saying you
                will be all right. Refusing to evacuate will pose more serious
                problems.</li>
              <li>Store as much food, water, light sources and batteries that
                are very useful in case of emergency.</li>
              <li>Volcanic eruptions have ash falls so be prepared for masks or
                anything to cover nose and mouth.</li>
              <li>Prioritize the safety of kids before other things. If you
                have relatives or friends who are far from the volcano, take
                your children there until such time that your place is safe.</li>

              <li>Avoid all low-lying places because lava flows and mudflows
                are more likely to pass here.</li>
                <li>Seek cover in case of ash falls rock falls.</li>
                <li>Use masks and cover your mouth and nose to avoid breathing in ashes.</li>
                <li>If you are inside a house; close all doors and windows to avoid ashes from getting inside.</li>
                <li>Always stay indoors.</li>
                <li>Stay in the evacuation center until further instructions. Do not attempt to leave the place unless told to do.</li>
                <li>Keep a watchful eye on the kids because they might be tempted to go out and see whatâ€™s going on outside.</li
